# Request Tracker Starter Guide

This guide was created to provide a basic introduction to the [Request Tracker](https://r9-rt5.stat.ubc.ca) ticketing system. 

## Logging in

Go to the [Request Tracker website](https://r9-rt5.stat.ubc.ca) on any modern browser.

A simple log in box will be shown, use your StatNet username and password to log in.

## Front page

When you first log in there will be several information panels shown.

The top bar will show options for creating tickets, searching tickets, reports, etc. You will likely never use those items except for the 'Logout' option which is shown when you hover over 'Logged in as username'.

The panel '10 highest priority tickets I own' is self-explanatory. Click the subject of any ticket in the panel to see the ticket info.

The panel under that is called '10 newest unowned tickets'. If you are assigned to multiple queues, it will show new tickets from all of those queues. 

The 'Bookmarked Tickets' shows tickets you have pinned aka bookmarked.

'Quick ticket creation' lets you create your own tickets if needed.

'My reminders' shows the reminders you created for yourself in any of your tickets.

'Queue list' shows the ticket queues you have been assigned to.

'Dashboards' can be ignored for now.

'Refresh' lets you choose how often to refresh the page so you can see new tickets added to the queue.

## Taking tickets

To start working on a ticket, go back to the panel '10 newest unowned tickets' and take the ticket by clicking 'Take'
