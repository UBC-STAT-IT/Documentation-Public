## Logging in

Go to the [Request Tracker website](https://r9-rt5.stat.ubc.ca) on any modern browser.

A simple log in box will be shown, use your StatNet username and password to log in.

## Front page

When you first log in there will be several information panels shown.

The top bar will show options for creating tickets, searching tickets, reports, etc. You will likely never use those items except for the 'Logout' option which is shown when you hover over 'Logged in as username'.

The panel '10 highest priority tickets I own' is self-explanatory. Click the subject of any ticket in the panel to see the ticket info.

The panel under that is called '10 newest unowned tickets'. If you are assigned to multiple queues, it will show new tickets from all of those queues. 

The 'Bookmarked Tickets' shows tickets you have pinned aka bookmarked.

'Quick ticket creation' lets you create your own tickets if needed.

'My reminders' shows the reminders you created for yourself in any of your tickets.

'Queue list' shows the ticket queues you have been assigned to.

'Dashboards' can be ignored for now.

'Refresh' lets you choose how often to refresh the page so you can see new tickets added to the queue.

## Taking tickets

To start working on a ticket, go back to the panel '10 newest unowned tickets' and take the ticket by clicking 'Take'.

<img width="956" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/582ba43e-0ac2-41d6-97ed-7d70bacdd0f6" />

This will give you ownership of the ticket and sends you to the page showing all of the ticket information aka 'Ticket metadata'.

This page shows you several panels:

'The basics' shows you the status of the ticket (open, closed, stalled, etc.) and its priority (defaults to low).  

'People' shows who owns the ticket, who created the ticket (requestor), and any other internal user who is notified when responses are created in the ticket (AdminCC, CC).

'More about the requestors' shows any of the requestors other tickets if they exist.

'Reminders' lets you set timed reminders for yourself to complete tasks.

'Dates' shows dates related to the request.

'Links' lets you link other tickets to the ticket you are currently looking at.

'History' shows all the changes made to the ticket and logs the messages between you and the requestor or anybody else. Latest replies or changes are on the bottom of the list.

## Removing requestors or CCs

Students will sometimes add unrelated faculty members or other staff as requestors or CCs for the ticket. To avoid spamming their inboxes, remove the faculty or staff from the ticket.

Click the ticket to go to its ticket summary and under 'Ticket Metadata' go to the 'People' panel.

Click the edit button on the 'People' panel.

Go to the name of the faculty or staff member and click the checkbox beside their name. Then click 'Save'.

## Forwarding a request

To forward a student request to another staff or faculty for review, open the ticket, go to the student's request and click the "Forward" icon on the top right.

<img width="1397" height="402" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea0c1d9a-1f25-48bc-9176-0ae07f764770" />

Fill the "To" field with whoever you want to forward the message to and type in any additional message in the text box.

The forwarding prompt doesn't show the student's original message, if want to see it at the same time then you will have to open another ticketing system window with the message or open it in your e-mails.

When you're done, click "Forward Message and Return"

## Replying to tickets

To reply to a ticket go to the 'History' panel and navigate to the latest message from the ticket requestor and click reply button (arrow pointing left).

<img width="1423" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed125e00-eb9b-427a-b911-dd9208aeffed" />

If you want to add others as a CC or BCC, add them to the 'One-time CC' and/or 'One-time BCC' areas. Remove any e-mails from these fields that shouldn't be a CC.

<img width="839" height="216" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93c94620-5afd-45bc-824d-f02415cfea2a" />

Hover over the top right of the input box and click the red arrow (not visible in the image) to "Insert paragraph here" which will let you start typing above the requestors reply.

<img width="930" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2945e6e8-2710-4c3e-b995-d764afbf6108" />

You can also add attachments by using the box under the input box 'Drop files here or click to attach'

When you're done click the 'Update ticket' button and your reply will be sent automatically to the requestor and anyone else CC'd on the conversation.

<img width="1470" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1600c5e6-8a27-4ffe-96a4-985e210ada1b" />

Student requestors are always notified by default when you send a message in a ticket. 

If you're replying to someone else other than the student requestor, for example someone you forwarded a message to, uncheck the student's e-mail under 'On Correspond Notify Requestors'. Also ensure whoever you're replying to is listed as a 'One-time CC' or 'One-time BCC'.

## Changing ticket owner

You may need to reassign the ticket to someone else or remove your ownership of the ticket (e.g. going on vacation).

To do that, open the ticket info page and go to the 'People' panel. Click the edit icon.

<img width="695" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/079588e2-39e7-4c84-a444-2bb3b43ba46a" />

Click the 'Owner' dropdown menu and choose who to assign the ticket to. Click 'Nobody in particular' to remove yourself as the owner and put the ticket back into the ticket queue for someone else to take.

<img width="695" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee3f47fd-2b3d-4da9-957e-75bc9b9a54b4" />

Finally click 'Save' on the bottom right.

## Changing ticket queue

The ticket may have been placed in the wrong queue, to change the assigned queue for the ticket:

Open the ticket info page and go to the 'The Basics' panel. Click the edit icon.

<img width="1221" height="231" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b440d22-0c7b-4157-ab15-b6f82dcd23fb" />

Click the 'Queue' dropdown menu and choose the correct queue for the ticket.

<img width="1068" height="291" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fad0947-3c17-4d4b-b543-299d816d07ae" />

Finally click 'Save' on the bottom right.

## Resolving tickets

Once you're satisfied that a ticket is resolved, open the ticket from the '10 highest priority tickets I own' page or the queue ticket list and go to 'The basics' panel.

Click the edit button on the top right of the panel.

<img width="706" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abeda3b9-6c40-4338-bafd-a2dd595c3609" />

Click the 'Status' dropdown menu and click 'resolved'. Then click the 'Save' button.

<img width="694" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c508754-78e6-45cd-a596-181045aab9b8" />

Otherwise if any of the other statuses match the situation, choose one of those instead.

If you resolved the ticket then the ticket will no longer be shown to you or anybody else on the front page or the ticket queue. It has been archived but can be found with the ticket search tool found on the top menu bar.

Finally click 'Save' on the bottom right.

## Checking resolved tickets

To look at tickets you have resolved, hover over the 'Reports' menu on the top menu bar and click the menu option for 'Resolved by owner'.

<img width="587" height="244" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00e859f5-250d-4306-9ed7-947ea0eff616" />

Choose the name of the queue you would like to check from the dropdown menu.

Go to the bar graph for your account and click the coloured bar above your account.

<img width="638" height="460" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d6e9370-c493-4c5b-9db6-beb265bac4ee" />

It will take you to the page with all the tickets you have resolved so far.

If you want to narrow down the search further, click the 'Edit search' button on the top right and it will give you several search options.

**Alternative** Use textual search described [here](#searching-for-tickets)

## Searching for tickets

If there is a certain ticket you're looking for, you can use the 'Simple search' function.

Go to the top menu bar and hover over 'Search' and then 'Tickets'. Click 'Simple search'

<img width="413" height="160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8089ef98-e7c6-4156-ab38-092f516f334c" />

To search, type in a textual query to find your tickets. If you just want to search for a certain keyword or string, then put single quotes and double quotes around it to search for that word e.g. '"registration"'

**EXAMPLES**

To search for a keyword or string: `'"STAT 302"'`

To search for a requestor (student): `requestor:ali.r.abbas@gmail.com`

To search for a subject: `subject:'STAT 301 registration'`

To search for all tickets (open, resolved, rejected, etc.): `status:any`

See all tickets in a queue: `queue:'Your queue name' status:any`

To search for all resolved tickets by you in a queue: `queue:'Your queue name' status:resolved owner:your.accountname`

Several other examples are listed on the search page for more options.

## Merging tickets
**WARNING: Only do this if you're sure the tickets are from the same student and are about an identical issue, this is an unreversible process.**

If you believe that two or more tickets from the same student are dealing with the same issue you can merge those tickets together to consolidate them into a single ticket for easier referencing.

To do so, take a note of the ticket number of the ticket you would like to keep at the end of the merging process i.e. the best ticket. 

Open the other ticket and click the edit button for the 'Links' section.

<img width="711" height="313" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5d5ac94-3548-4210-92fa-fb7b9707aeea" />

After clicking the edit button, you'll see a line with the title "Merge into:". Put the ticket number noted earlier into that line and click 'Save'.

<img width="689" height="177" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c799abbf-0ddd-4634-8b05-813e99f315e0" />

If the merge was successful then the ticket you kept will have all the info/correspondence from the other ticket.

## Logging out

When you're done, make sure to log out using the option on the top menu bar:
