# Nextcloud Migration/Startup Guide

Nextcloud (owncloud.stat.ubc.ca) is a cloud storage service that provides Statistics users with 50GB of file storage. If you aren't already using Nextcloud, you can get started with the [startup guide](#startup-guide).

We will be migrating to a new Nextcloud server as the old Nextcloud server's operating system is reaching end of life status. This document aims to assist Statistics staff, faculty, and students with the transition over to the new server.

During the migration window, access to Nextcloud will be temporarily suspended. Any files already synced locally to your device should still be accessible, however files will not be synced to or downloaded from the server.

If you encounter any issues with the guides below, contact STAT IT at help@stat.ubc.ca for assistance.

## After Migration Steps

The Statistics IT team will notify all users when the migration has completed through e-mail and Slack. Once you receive the notification, please follow the steps below if you were using Nextcloud before the migration.

1\. Go to your system tray and click the Nextcloud icon to open the Nextcloud window.

Follow the prompts on screen to install the latest version of the Nextcloud client. Reboot your device once completed.

5\. Retry steps 1 and 2. If you still do not receive the **All synced!** message, you can try re-installing Nextcloud from [here](https://nextcloud.com/install/) under **Download for Desktop**, try [adding another account](#add-another-account),  or contact Statistics IT support help@stat.ubc.ca.

**Note**: If you find the macOS 12+ installer does not work, try the macOS Virtual Files 12+ installer.

6\. Go to the Nextcloud folder located on your device and check that your files can be opened, renamed, and saved. If so, then your client has been migrated successfully.
